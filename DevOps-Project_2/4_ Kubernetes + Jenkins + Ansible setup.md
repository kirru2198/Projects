Got it — you just shared a detailed walkthrough of your Kubernetes + Jenkins + Ansible setup and automation process. Here’s a summarized, structured recap of what you did, to make sure I understand fully and to help you with next steps if needed:

---

### Your Setup & Workflow Summary

1. **Machines Setup:**

   * **Jenkins Master (Jenkins M) machine** — manually launched, has Terraform & now Ansible installed.
   * **Kubernetes Master (KM) machine** — created via Terraform.
   * **Kubernetes Slave 1 (KS1) machine** — created via Terraform.
   * **Kubernetes Slave 2 (KS2) machine** — created via Terraform.

2. **Initial Steps:**

   * Connected to all three Kubernetes machines (KM, KS1, KS2).
   * Ran `sudo apt update` on all three.
   * Installed Ansible on Jenkins M machine by creating and executing an install script.

3. **SSH Setup:**

   * Generated SSH key pair (`ssh-keygen`) on Jenkins M.
   * Copied the **public key** (`id_rsa.pub`) from Jenkins M.
   * Pasted that public key into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on KM, KS1, and KS2 — enabling passwordless SSH from Jenkins M to all Kubernetes machines.

4. **Ansible Inventory:**

   * Edited Ansible `hosts` file (`/etc/ansible/hosts`) on Jenkins M.
   * Added private IPs for KM, KS1, KS2.
   * Grouped them with labels:

     * `km` for Kubernetes master (will have Java + Kubernetes + Jenkins slave).
     * `ks` for Kubernetes slaves (will have Kubernetes only).

5. **Testing Connection:**

   * Ran `ansible -m ping all` to confirm Ansible can communicate with all machines via SSH.

6. **Playbook Preparation:**

   * Will write a playbook to install:

     * On Jenkins M (localhost): Java + Jenkins.
     * On Kubernetes Master (km): Java + Kubernetes (because it's also Jenkins slave).
     * On Kubernetes Slaves (ks group): Kubernetes only.
   * Installation of Docker will be done manually later after Kubernetes installation.

### Next Steps / What You May Want to Do

* Write the **Ansible playbook (`play.yaml`)** with multiple plays targeting different hosts/groups with appropriate tasks for each.
* Prepare **scripts or tasks** for installing Java, Jenkins, Kubernetes on respective machines.
* Execute the playbook via Ansible on Jenkins M.
* Verify successful installations.
* Manually install Docker on Kubernetes nodes (or optionally automate via Ansible later).
* Add Kubernetes master node as Jenkins slave in Jenkins dashboard.
* Continue automation for deployment pipeline using Jenkins and Kubernetes.

### Example Snippet of Your Ansible Playbook Structure (simplified):

```yaml
---
- name: Install Java and Jenkins on Jenkins Master
  hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Run install script for Java and Jenkins
      script: ./localhost.sh

- name: Install Java and Kubernetes on Kubernetes Master (also Jenkins slave)
  hosts: km
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install Java
      apt:
        name: openjdk-11-jdk
        state: present
    - name: Install Kubernetes packages
      shell: |
        # your kubernetes install commands here

- name: Install Kubernetes on Kubernetes Slaves
  hosts: ks
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install Kubernetes packages
      shell: |
        # your kubernetes install commands here
```
