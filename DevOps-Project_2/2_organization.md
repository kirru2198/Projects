Here’s a simplified breakdown of the architecture and setup:

1. **Machine 1 (Jenkins Master)**:

   * **Software Installed**: Java, Jenkins.
   * **Role**: This will act as the Jenkins master.

2. **Machine 2 (Kubernetes Master and Jenkins Slave)**:

   * **Software Installed**: Java, Kubernetes.
   * **Role**: This machine will act as the **Kubernetes Master** and also the **Jenkins Slave** (since it will be added to the Jenkins dashboard).

3. **Machine 3 and Machine 4 (Kubernetes Slaves)**:

   * **Software Installed**: Kubernetes, Docker.
   * **Role**: These machines will act as **Kubernetes Slaves**. These will not have Jenkins installed, so they are not added to the Jenkins dashboard.

### Key Points:

* **Jenkins Master** (Machine 1) will handle Jenkins tasks.
* **Kubernetes Master** (Machine 2) will manage Kubernetes tasks and act as a Jenkins Slave.
* **Kubernetes Slaves** (Machine 3 and 4) will be dedicated to Kubernetes tasks and will not be used for Jenkins tasks.
* **Slaves** are created to ensure that each machine has a specific role, making the system more organized and efficient.
* Machines that are Kubernetes Slaves will not be added to the Jenkins dashboard, so they won’t need Java installed.

### Why Slaves?

* To avoid putting all tasks on a single machine, which could make the system clumsy and inefficient.
* Slaves ensure that each task (e.g., Jenkins tasks, Kubernetes tasks) is handled by a machine dedicated to it.

This setup ensures that the system is modular and organized, with specific roles for each machine.
