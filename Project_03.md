# Jenkins Setup and Node Configuration for DevOps Project

### Introduction

In this section, we will walk through the process of setting up Jenkins on the Jenkins Master machine, configuring the necessary nodes (Slave Machines), and creating jobs for building and deploying the application.

### Step 1: Launch Jenkins Dashboard

We have installed Jenkins on the Jenkins Master machine. Now, to access the Jenkins dashboard:

1. **Copy the public IP of the Jenkins Master machine**.
2. Open a new tab in your browser and paste the public IP followed by `:8080` to access the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Example: `http://<Jenkins_Master_IP>:8080`

Once you access the Jenkins dashboard, it will prompt you for an administrator password.

### Step 2: Fetch the Administrator Password

To retrieve the Jenkins admin password:

1. On the Jenkins Master machine (which is where Jenkins is installed), run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```
2. **Copy the admin password** that is displayed in the terminal.

### Step 3: Install Suggested Plugins

1. Paste the admin password into the Jenkins setup page to log in.
2. Click **Install Suggested Plugins** to install the necessary plugins for Jenkins.

### Step 4: Set Up Jenkins User

1. After plugin installation, you will be prompted to set up a Jenkins username and password.
2. Enter the username and password (e.g., your name or any desired username).

Click **Save and Finish**, and the Jenkins dashboard should now be ready.

### Step 5: Configure Jenkins Nodes (Slave Machines)

Now, we need to configure the nodes (Slave machines) for Jenkins. We will set up two nodes:

1. **Test Node**: This will be associated with `Slave 1` for building and testing code from the `develop` branch.
2. **Prod Node**: This will be associated with `Slave 2` for deploying the application to the production environment.

#### **Configuring Test Node (Slave 1)**

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** â†’ **Manage Nodes**.
2. Click **New Node**.
3. Provide the node name as `test` and select **Permanent Agent**.
4. Click **OK** to proceed to the node configuration.
5. Set the following configurations:
   - **Remote Root Directory**: `/home/ubuntu/jenkins`
   - **Label**: `test`
   - **Launch method**: **Launch via SSH**
   - **Host**: Enter the private IP address of the `Slave 1` machine.
   - **Credentials**: Choose **SSH Username with private key**. Add the private key content from the `Slave 1` machine.
   
6. Click **Save** to create the node.

After saving, the `test` node should appear in the **Available** state on the **Manage Nodes** page.

#### **Configuring Prod Node (Slave 2)**

1. Click **New Node** again to create the `prod` node.
2. Provide the node name as `prod` and select **Permanent Agent**.
3. Click **OK** to proceed to the node configuration.
4. Set the following configurations:
   - **Remote Root Directory**: `/home/ubuntu/jenkins`
   - **Label**: `prod`
   - **Launch method**: **Launch via SSH**
   - **Host**: Enter the private IP address of the `Slave 2` machine.
   - **Credentials**: Choose **SSH Username with private key**. Use the same private key content from the `Slave 1` machine.
   
5. Click **Save** to create the node.

### Step 6: Troubleshooting Node Launch

- If a node does not launch properly, verify the private IP and ensure the correct SSH keys are configured for both nodes.
- If the node fails to connect, check that the **Host Key Verification Strategy** is set to **Non-verifying** (since this disables strict host key verification).

### Step 7: Create Jenkins Jobs

Now that the nodes are set up, we can create Jenkins jobs for the tasks:

1. **Job 1: Build for Master Branch** (on `test` node):
   - Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click **New Item**.
   - Enter the name of the job (e.g., `Job1`).
   - Choose **Freestyle project** and click **OK**.
   - In the **Source Code Management** section, link the GitHub repository and specify the **master** branch.
   - In the **Build Environment** section, add the test node label (`test`) to ensure the job runs on the `Slave 1` machine.
   - Save the job configuration.

2. **Job 2: Build for Develop Branch** (on `test` node):
   - Create another job named `Job2` similar to `Job1`.
   - This time, specify the **develop** branch in the **Source Code Management** section.
   - Link it to the **test** node again.

3. **Job 3: Build and Deploy to Production** (on `prod` node):
   - Create a new job named `Job3`.
   - Specify the **master** branch for this job.
   - Link it to the **prod** node (for production deployment).
   - Add a build step to build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t newIMG .
     ```
   - Add a step to run the Docker container on port 93:
     ```bash
     docker run -it -d -p 93:80 --name=C1 newIMG
     ```
   - Configure the job to deploy the app to the production server and expose it in the browser.

### Step 8: Trigger Jobs Automatically Using Webhooks

- **Set up GitHub webhook**: In the GitHub repository, configure a webhook to trigger Jenkins jobs when a push is made to the repository.
- The webhook will notify Jenkins whenever there is a change (commit) to the repository, triggering the jobs accordingly.

### Step 9: Resolving Port Conflict

If you encounter an error when trying to build the job again (due to port conflicts), follow these steps:

1. **Error Cause**: The error occurs because the port (93) is already assigned to a running container.
2. **Solution**: Add a cleanup command to remove the previously created container before running the new one:
   ```bash
   sudo docker rm -f <container_name>
   ```

This ensures that Jenkins will remove the old container and avoid port conflicts when deploying the new container.

### Conclusion

With the steps above, you have successfully set up Jenkins, configured nodes, created jobs for building and deploying your application, and resolved common issues. The entire process is now automated, ensuring that every time you make changes to the repository, Jenkins will automatically build and deploy the app, reflecting changes in real-time.
