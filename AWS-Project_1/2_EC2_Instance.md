Here's a clear and well-structured version of your instructions for launching and configuring an **EC2 instance** on AWS, including **security group setup** and key notes for real-world use:

---

## ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step: Launch & Configure EC2 Instance for Web App + RDS Setup**

### üî∏ **Objective**

Launch a main EC2 instance where you will:

* Configure the web server (e.g., PHP-based site)
* Set up everything needed
* Create an **AMI** (Amazon Machine Image) from it
* Use this AMI in a **Launch Template** for Auto Scaling later

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Launch EC2 Instance**

* Go to the EC2 Dashboard ‚Üí Click on **‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù**
* **Instance Name**: `MainInstance`
* **Purpose**: This instance is only for setting up and creating the AMI

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Key Pair**

* Use an existing key pair or create a new one
* This will be needed later to SSH into the instance if required

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Configure Network & Security Group**

Click on **‚ÄúEdit Security Groups‚Äù** and:

* **Security Group Name**: `WickProject1-SecurityGroup`

#### üîê Add Inbound Rules:

| Type               | Protocol | Port Range | Source               |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| HTTP               | TCP      | 80         | Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) |
| MySQL/Aurora (RDS) | TCP      | 3306       | Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: Using "Anywhere" is only for practice/demo purposes.
> In real production, **never** use "Anywhere". Use a **specific CIDR range** to lock down traffic for enhanced security.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. User Data (Optional for Automation)**

You can leave the **User Data** section empty for now.

> Why? Because we‚Äôll SSH or use EC2 Instance Connect to manually:

* Install Apache or NGINX
* Add PHP code or deploy the web app
* Configure DB connection settings

(If preferred, you can automate this with a startup script using `User Data`.)

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Launch the Instance**

Once all the settings are good:

* Click **‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù**
* Wait for the instance to initialize

---

### ‚úÖ **6. Connect to the Instance**

After the instance is in a **Running** state:

* Go to EC2 Dashboard ‚Üí Select the instance ‚Üí Click **‚ÄúConnect‚Äù**
* Use **EC2 Instance Connect** or **SSH client** (if key is set up locally)

---

### ‚úÖ **7. Notes on Protocols**

* Most AWS services communicate over **TCP**
* Web traffic:

  * HTTP = Port **80**
  * HTTPS = Port **443**
* Database (MySQL/RDS) = Port **3306**
* These ports are **entry points** and define how the service can be accessed

---

### ‚úÖ **Network Protocols Recap**

| Protocol | Use Case                                                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| TCP      | Reliable data delivery (Web, DB)                         |
| UDP      | Faster, but no delivery guarantee (e.g., streaming, DNS) |
